# KwikDeploy

## Simplified container deployments and management

KwikDeploy is a graphical user interface for making it easy to deploy and manage containers.

The project is under active development and currently we are in the prototyping
stage. In the first release we are aiming to support Docker deployments to Virtual Machines.
In future releases we will add support for Kubernetes.
