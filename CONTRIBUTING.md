# Contributing to KwikDeploy
Thank you for considering to contribute to KwikDeploy. Every contribution helps!

Contribution does not only mean writing code and sending pull requests. You can 
contribute in other ways too like:

- Reporting a bug
- Proposing new features
- Updating the documentation
- Writing tests

## We use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html). All code changes happen via pull requests.
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)).

Currently the project is in the prototyping phase. We do not expect perfect code in this phase - fairly good code is fine.

We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `develop`.
2. Make you changes and ensure that the code builds and runs fine.
3. Issue a pull request to the `develop` branch.

## All contributions will be under the MIT License
When you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/)
that covers the project.

## Report bugs using GitHub [Issues](https://github.com/KwikDeploy/kwikdeploy/issues)
We use GitHub Issues to track bugs. You can report a bug by [opening a new issue].

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
